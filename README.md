# All-Purpose Espresso Controller HV Board

*Note: The HV does stand for high voltage. It's not high voltage in the technical (>1000 V) sense, but compared to the 12 V in the regular All-Purpose Espresso Controller board, 100-240 VAC is high*

This board is a companion board to the [All Purpose Espresso Controller](https://github.com/open-lcc/all-purpose-espresso-controller) board. Its purpose is to handle some common 100-240 VAC tasks, specifically it has a 12V PSU and four relays.

## Project status

The current hardware revision is R0B. That revision hasn't been manufactured yet, and while this board is pretty simple, and doesn't have any SMD soldering, you probably shouldn't be the first one to manufacture it.

## Disclaimer

Anything you do with this, you do at your own risk. This hardware hasn't even been manufactured by it's creator yet. Your machine uses both line voltage power, high pressured hot water, steam and other dangerous components. You *really* shouldn't be using this yet; in fact, you shouldn't even consider it. Risks include but are not limited to, damaging your machine, personal injury, property damage and summoning dead Cthulhu from his sleep at R'lyeh.

Also, the very purpose of this board is to do things with line voltage. The risk of injury or damage is very real.
